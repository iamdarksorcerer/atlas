# atlas
Atlas provides examples of custom annotation creation
* Using AOP (atlas core + atlas core starter + atlas sample)
* Using pure Spring's BeanPostProcessor (atlas core light + atlas starter light + atlas sample light)

Each way has spring its boot starter project which allows automatic bootstrapping of atlas functionality, as well as 
examples of each way.

The Atlas annotation supported both on class and on method level.
